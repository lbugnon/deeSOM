Description: DeeSOM  
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Self-organized map based classifier, developed to deal with large and highly imbalanced data.

        The methods automatically build several layers of SOM. Data is clustered and samples that
        are not likely to be positive class member are discarded at each level.  
        
        The elastic-deepSOM (elasticSOM) is a deep architecture of SOM layers where the map
        size is automatically set in each layer according to the data filtered in each previous 
        map. The ensemble-elasticSOM (eeSOM) uses several SOMs in ensemble layers to
        face the high imbalance challenges. These new models are particularly suited
        to handle problems where there is a labeled class of interest (positive
        class) that is significantly under-represented with respect to a higher number
        of unlabeled data.
